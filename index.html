              I'm a self taught
              <strong class="text--blue">frontend software engineer</strong>
              with a great talent for creating responsive websites. Although I
              do enjoy making and sharing great user experiences my true passion
              is in the creation and coding of video games. When I was younger I
              didn't have much time to really think about what I wanted as an
              individual. Learning to code has saved me in more ways than one
              and its helped me finally understand who I can be.

                  In middle school I was too focused on being the perfect
                  student and the perfect daughter. I joined drama club right at
                  the beginning of 6th grade as stage crew and between moving
                  sets, fixing lights and costumes my only goal was to be the
                  perfect member of our club. Thats who I was until I graduated
                  and become a highschool student.

                  Even in highschool I left no room for thought just progress. I
                  was a student, athlete, and part-time employee all at the age
                  of 14. When I turned 16 my junior year in highschool I joined
                  CTEC which was a career technical program and I was in the Law
                  Enforcement Program. Everyday from 6 in the morning till 10 at
                  night my time wasn't my own but I enjoyed what I did. A
                  perfect student doesn't have the ability to be anything more
                  than a perfect student. Life and decisions both in and out of
                  my hands brought me to a place where after I graduated I was
                  lost.
