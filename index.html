              I'm a self taught
              <strong class="text--blue">frontend software engineer</strong>
              with a great talent for creating responsive websites. Although I
              do enjoy making and sharing great user experiences my true passion
              is in the creation and coding of video games. When I was younger I
              didn't have much time to really think about what I wanted as an
              individual. Learning to code has saved me in more ways than one
              and its helped me finally understand who I can be.

        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        <p>
          In middle school I was too focused on being the perfect student and
          the perfect daughter. I joined drama club right at the beginning of
          6th grade as stage crew and between moving sets, fixing lights and
          costumes my only goal was to be the perfect member of our club. Thats
          who I was until I graduated and become a highschool student. Even in
          highschool I left no room for thought just progress. I was a student,
          athlete, and part-time employee all at the age of 14. When I turned 16
          my junior year in highschool I joined CTEC which was a career
          technical program and I was in the Law Enforcement Program. Everyday
          from 6 in the morning till 10 at night my time wasn't my own but I
          enjoyed what I did. A perfect student doesn't have the ability to be
          anything more than a perfect student. Life and decisions both in and
          out of my hands brought me to a place where after I graduated I was
          lost.
